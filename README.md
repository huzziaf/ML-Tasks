# ML/AI Tasks
  
## Task 1 - Car price prediction model
Implemented 3 models i.e. RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTree, and LinearRegression for prediciton of a 'Price' variables depending on 'Make', 'Model', 'Registration', 'Mileage', etc. Saved the best performing model in the `saved models` directory.

## Task 2 - Movie recommendation system
Implemented kNN with cosine similarity metric in order to recommend 'k' most similar movies based on the inputted movie. 

## Structure
- **`source`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks for both tasks.
- **`saved models`**: Contains trained models for both tasks in `.pkl` format
- **`data`**: Contains dataset for each task in `.csv` format.
- **`Report.pdf`**: A summary report outlining my approach and challenges faced whilst attempting these tasks.
